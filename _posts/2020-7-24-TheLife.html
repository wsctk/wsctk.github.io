    <p class="textline">Life is a cup of coffee, what we do everyday is try to add different condiment to our cup in front the table to make the cofffee taste not so painful but other flavour we like or we want to like. Someone want it sweet, some other one maybe want it mellow. What we all should know is that the final taste of the it is absolutely decided by ourselves not any other one. Someone listens to other one so easily and at the same time has an unexpected awful taste of it, then they think the coffee is designed to be so painful that people are bearing it if they want to have water, so they refuse to try to turn it to some flavour they like. Everyone has only one cup of coffee, what you should do is to create your flavour, all of this is technically meaningless, but we choose to do it because that's what we who have no rights to choose when and where to born can do to feel whether we exist in this big, cold, complex universe!</p>
